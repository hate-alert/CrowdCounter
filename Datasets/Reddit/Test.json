The EULAs, the Terms of Service, and the selling of software of a service, and the SJW convergence have all collectively routed around the rule of law which is necessary for sustained economic growth over time. In countries with strong rule of law: >> 1. Property rights over land, equipment, and personal items are clear and protected by law. >> 2. Contracts between people, businesses, and the government are effectively enforced by the legal system. >> 3. Political accountability is high and corruption is low. >> 4. Business regulations are clear and enforced in a transparent manner. > In such environments people make long-term investments and build large organizations. In contrast, if the property rights and contracts are not enforced and the business regulations are not clear, most of the economy consists of small family owned firms with little modern equipment.

For example, as far as I can tell, and certainly in practice, domain names are property only when a unit of the US government wants to seize one.

{"hatespeech":" >The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone, Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable. >They see the platform owners as \"hospitality organizers\". That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: \"People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to\". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct. >For one, I don't see google\/twitter\/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider. These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email. >Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term \"illegal aliens\" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report. >Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\". Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency.
